## How to run Unittests

While being in the `Map_Project` directory (I.E., this directory), simply run `python -m unittest discover`.

To run unit tests and hide the print statements (I.E., the terminal outputs), add `-b` to the command so you have `python -m unittest discover -b`.

I might have plans in the future to make this something you can do in Pipenv Shell or something, I don't know.
