## How to run this dang game

First of all, you'll need Python to run this, at LEAST Python version 3.9. Probably any version of Python 3 would work, though that's untested. If you need to get a working version of Python, you can download it [here.](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Once you've got Python installed, you're good to go. Just type `python run_game.py` to run the game and the game will prompt you on what to do.

## How to run Unittests

While being in the `Map_Project` directory (I.E., this directory), simply run `python -m unittest discover`.

To run unit tests and hide the print statements (I.E., the terminal outputs), add `-b` to the command so you have `python -m unittest discover -b`.

I might have plans in the future to make this something you can do in Pipenv Shell or something, I don't know.
