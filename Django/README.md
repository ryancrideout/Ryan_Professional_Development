# Django

This is just a Django tutorial so that I can become familiar with Django.

Worth noting that you will need Django to run this project, and that can be accomplished with `python -m pip install Django`.

Because I'm forgetful, this is the username and password for Django admin:
`Username: ryan.rideout`
`Password: machinegunkiss`
`Email: ryan.rideout@example.com`
